# JugGrNotesApp
This repository contains the sample project that was coded during the sessions in the juggr meetings (http://www.jug-gr.de/2015/03/25/android.html and http://www.jug-gr.de/2015/05/27/advanced-android.html).

For the first session the Code Base was developed until the commit with ID f786b196. The second session builds on the state given by the named commit. All following commits will show the refactoring of the app using patterns and frameworks step by step.

At the end of the session the usage of all presented patterns and framworks has been shown in the code base, whereas the refactoring could not be completed for the whole app at this point.
